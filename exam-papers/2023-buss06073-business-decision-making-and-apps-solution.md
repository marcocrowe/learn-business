## Question 1 [Total Marks: 50]

### Question 1(a) [15 Marks]

The Burren Gift Shops bestselling product are photographic prints of the Cliffs of Moher. The policy for maintaining optimum stock levels is to keep 40% of the following months' projected sales of the prints in stock. Each print costs €20. The manager has provided details of projected sales for the next four months.

Details are as follows:

|                          |  June |  July | August | September |
|--------------------------|------:|------:|-------:|----------:|
| Number of sales of print | 1,500 | 1,700 |  1,900 |     1,400 |

At the 31<sup>st</sup> of May, the shop will have 750 prints in stock.

**Required:**
Prepare the monthly purchases budget in units and euros for the prints for the months June, July and August

#### Answer 1(a)

The first step is to calculate the number of prints required to be in stock at the end of each month. This is done by multiplying the projected sales for the following month by 40% and then adding the number of prints in stock at the end of the previous month.

| Month    | Projected Sales | 40% of Projected Sales | Number of Prints in Stock |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------:|--------------------------:|
| June     |           1,500 |                     600 |                     1,350 |
| July     |           1,700 |                     680 |                     2,050 |
| August   |           1,900 |                     760 |                     2,810 |
| September|           1,400 |                     560 |                     2,370 |

#### Answer 1(a) (ii)

1. **Calculate Required Ending Inventory:**

   For each month, the ending inventory is 40% of the following month's projected sales.

   - **June:**
     - Ending Inventory = 40% of July Sales
     - Ending Inventory = 0.40 * 1,700 = 680 prints

   - **July:**
     - Ending Inventory = 40% of August Sales
     - Ending Inventory = 0.40 * 1,900 = 760 prints

   - **August:**
     - Ending Inventory = 40% of September Sales
     - Ending Inventory = 0.40 * 1,400 = 560 prints

2. **Calculate Total Prints Needed:**

   Total prints needed each month is the sum of the projected sales for the month and the required ending inventory.

   - **June:**
     - Total Prints Needed = June Sales + Ending Inventory
     - Total Prints Needed = 1,500 + 680 = 2,180 prints

   - **July:**
     - Total Prints Needed = July Sales + Ending Inventory
     - Total Prints Needed = 1,700 + 760 = 2,460 prints

   - **August:**
     - Total Prints Needed = August Sales + Ending Inventory
     - Total Prints Needed = 1,900 + 560 = 2,460 prints

3. **Calculate Prints to be Purchased:**

   Prints to be purchased each month is the total prints needed minus the beginning inventory.

   - **June:**
     - Beginning Inventory = 750 prints (from the end of May)
     - Prints to be Purchased = Total Prints Needed - Beginning Inventory
     - Prints to be Purchased = 2,180 - 750 = 1,430 prints

   - **July:**
     - Beginning Inventory = Ending Inventory of June = 680 prints
     - Prints to be Purchased = 2,460 - 680 = 1,780 prints

   - **August:**
     - Beginning Inventory = Ending Inventory of July = 760 prints
     - Prints to be Purchased = 2,460 - 760 = 1,700 prints

4. **Calculate Cost of Prints to be Purchased:**

   Each print costs €20.

   - **June:**
     - Cost = 1,430 prints * €20 = €28,600

   - **July:**
     - Cost = 1,780 prints * €20 = €35,600

   - **August:**
     - Cost = 1,700 prints * €20 = €34,000

**Purchases Budget:**

| Month | Prints to be Purchased | Cost (€)   |
|-------|------------------------:|-----------:|
| June  |                  1,430  |    28,600  |
| July  |                  1,780  |    35,600  |
| August|                  1,700  |    34,000  |

### Question 1(b) [15 Marks]

> "Pay is a great motivator in achieving Budget Targets and Company Goals"

Discuss, providing one argument both for and against the above statement.

#### Answer 1(b)

**Argument For:**

Pay can be a powerful motivator for several reasons:

- **Direct Financial Incentive:** Higher pay or performance-based bonuses provide a direct financial benefit to employees, encouraging them to meet or exceed budget targets.
- **Recognition and Reward:** Increased pay or bonuses can serve as recognition for hard work and achievement, fostering a sense of accomplishment and encouraging continued effort.
- **Attract and Retain Talent:** Competitive pay helps attract skilled workers and retain existing employees, ensuring that the company has the necessary human resources to achieve its goals.
- **Improved Morale and Productivity:** Financial incentives can improve overall employee morale and productivity, leading to better performance and higher likelihood of meeting budget targets and company goals.

**Argument Against:**

However, there are also drawbacks to relying on pay as a motivator:

- **Short-Term Focus:** Pay incentives might lead to a short-term focus where employees aim to meet immediate targets at the expense of long-term objectives and sustainability.
- **Unhealthy Competition:** Excessive emphasis on pay can create unhealthy competition among employees, leading to a toxic work environment and undermining teamwork and collaboration.
- **Diminished Intrinsic Motivation:** Over-reliance on extrinsic rewards like pay can diminish intrinsic motivation, where employees might lose interest in their work and only focus on financial gains.
- **Cost:** Financial incentives can be costly for the company, especially if not aligned properly with actual performance improvements, leading to inefficiencies and financial strain.

In conclusion, while pay can be an effective motivator, it needs to be balanced with other forms of recognition and support to ensure long-term success and employee well-being.

### Question 1(c) [20 Marks]

>"Poor attitudes or hostile behaviour can emerge, both at the planning stage of a Budget and at the implementation stage of a Budget."

Discuss the above statement providing appropriate examples from the workplace.

#### Answer 1(c)

Budget planning and implementation are critical stages in an organization's financial management process. However, they can also be sources of tension and conflict, leading to poor attitudes and hostile behavior among employees. Several factors contribute to this:

1. **Lack of Participation:**
   - When employees are excluded from the budgeting process, they may feel undervalued and disengaged. For instance, if departmental managers are not consulted while setting budget targets, they might view these targets as unrealistic or unfair, leading to resistance and lack of commitment.
2. **Unrealistic Expectations:**
   - Budgets that set overly ambitious targets without considering practical constraints can demoralize employees. For example, if sales teams are given unattainable sales targets, they may become frustrated, leading to decreased motivation and effort.
3. **Inadequate Communication:**
   - Poor communication during the budgeting process can result in misunderstandings and mistrust. If employees are not adequately informed about the reasons behind budget decisions, they may perceive them as arbitrary or biased, fostering resentment and hostility.
4. **Pressure and Stress:**
   - The pressure to meet budget targets can cause significant stress among employees. For instance, if cost-cutting measures are implemented without considering the workload and capacity of staff, it can lead to burnout, absenteeism, and even turnover.
5. **Blame Culture:**
   - When budget targets are not met, a blame culture may develop where individuals or departments are scapegoated. This can create a hostile work environment, where employees are more focused on avoiding blame than on collaborative problem-solving.

**Examples from the Workplace:**

- **Planning Stage:**
  - In a manufacturing company, the finance department sets a budget without consulting the production team. The production targets are unrealistic given the current machinery and workforce. This results in the production team feeling alienated and demotivated, leading to conflicts between departments.
- **Implementation Stage:**
  - In a retail company, budget cuts are made to reduce operational costs. However, the cuts are implemented without considering the impact on store staff, who are now expected to manage increased workloads with fewer resources. This leads to high stress, decreased job satisfaction, and increased staff turnover.

**Strategies to Mitigate Poor Attitudes and Hostile Behaviour:**

1. **Inclusive Budgeting Process:**
   - Involve employees at all levels in the budgeting process. Seek input from various departments to set realistic and achievable targets, ensuring buy-in and commitment.
2. **Transparent Communication:**
   - Clearly communicate the rationale behind budget decisions. Provide regular updates and be open to feedback, fostering a culture of trust and collaboration.
3. **Supportive Environment:**
   - Provide adequate support and resources to help employees meet budget targets. Recognize and address potential stressors, and promote a healthy work-life balance.
4. **Focus on Collaboration:**
   - Encourage teamwork and collective problem-solving rather than a blame culture. Recognize and reward collaborative efforts that contribute to achieving budget goals.

By addressing these factors, organizations can create a more positive and productive environment during both the planning and implementation stages of the budgeting process.
