### Question 1.B (11 marks)

Identify and list all of the paths on the network diagram and the duration of each path.  

### Answer 1.B

1. **Path 1**: `1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`  
   Duration = `10 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 10 = 46`

2. **Path 2**: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`  
   Duration = `10 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 8 + 10 = 48`

3. **Path 3**: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`  
   Duration = `10 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 10 = 46`

4. **Path 4**: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`  
   Duration = `12 + 6 + 10 + 8 + 10 = 46`

5. **Path 5**: `1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`  
   Duration = `12 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 10 = 44`

6. **Path 6**: `1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8`  
   Duration = `12 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 36`

Thus, the paths and their corresponding durations are listed as shown above.

### Question 1.C (10 marks)

Identify the critical path of the project and explain the importance of the critical path.  

### Answer 1.C

**Critical Path Identification:**

To identify the critical path, we need to determine which of the paths has the longest duration. The critical path is the sequence of activities that determines the minimum time required to complete the project. Any delay in this path will delay the entire project.

From the paths and durations listed earlier:

1. **Path 1**: `1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`  
   Duration = 46

2. **Path 2**: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`  
   Duration = 48

3. **Path 3**: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`  
   Duration = 46

4. **Path 4**: `1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`  
   Duration = 44

5. **Path 5**: `1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8`  
   Duration = 36

**Critical Path:** The critical path is **Path 2: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8`** with a duration of **48 units of time**.

**Importance of the Critical Path:**

The critical path is crucial because it determines the shortest possible duration to complete the project. The importance of the critical path includes:

1. **Project Duration**: The critical path dictates the minimum project completion time. Any delay in an activity on the critical path will directly delay the entire project.

2. **Resource Allocation**: Activities on the critical path require careful monitoring and efficient allocation of resources since any delays can impact the overall project timeline.

3. **Risk Management**: Identifying the critical path helps project managers focus on the most crucial activities. By ensuring these activities stay on schedule, the risk of project delays can be minimized.

4. **Scheduling and Control**: The critical path provides a clear picture of the essential tasks that need priority attention, allowing for better scheduling and control of the project.

By focusing on the critical path, project managers can ensure timely project completion and better manage potential risks and delays.

If say Path 5 is delayed by 2 units of time, the path duration of path 5 will be 36 + 2 = 38. This will not affect the project duration as it is not on the critical path. However, if Path 2 is delayed by 2 units of time, the path duration of path 2 will be 48 + 2 = 50. This will affect the project duration as it is on the critical path.

## Alternate Question 1

Given the following project activities and their dependencies, draw a Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM) network diagram. Place the activity nodes in boxes and draw arrows from node to node, indicating the dependencies between the activities. Label each node with the activity letter and its estimated duration.

| Activity | Preceding Activity | Estimated Duration |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| A        | -                  | 10                 |
| B        | -                  | 12                 |
| C        | A                  | 8                  |
| D        | A                  | 4                  |
| E        | B, D               | 6                  |
| F        | B                  | 6                  |
| G        | C, E               | 10                 |
| H        | E                  | 12                 |
| I        | F, H               | 8                  |
| J        | F                  | 8                  |
| K        | G, I               | 8                  |
| L        | J, K               | 10                 |
