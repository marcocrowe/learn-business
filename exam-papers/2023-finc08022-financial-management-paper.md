## Question 2

Bronx Ltd (BL) is an Irish company and a leading manufacturer of farm machinery. The financial manager of BL is considering investing in a modern industrial plant that it has the opportunity to purchase from a smaller rival company. This industrial plant is expected to have a further lifespan of only four years. The directors of Bronx Ltd require a return on major capital investments of 10%.

1. Market research carried by BL indicates the following contribution amounts can be expected per annum:

| Year         | Y1         | Y2         | Y3         | Y4         |
|--------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Contribution | €1,350,000 | €3,120,000 | €3,580,000 | €1,245,000 |

2. Bronx Ltd has already spent **€250,000** assessing the viability of the investment and a further **€156,000** on market research. The business has already paid in cash the entire viability expense but only fifty percent of the market research has been paid.

3. This industrial plant will cost **€5,810,000**. Payment will be made immediately. The correct depreciation method is **25% straight line** over a four-year period. The equipment has an estimated residual value of **€750,000**, at the end of four years.

4. Bronx Limited incurs annual fixed overheads of **€295,000** for rent of office buildings in Limerick City. Ten percent of this rental amount is to be reallocated towards the contribution from this new investment.

5. Working capital of **€740,000** will be required immediately and this will be released at the end of the project’s life.

6. A supplementary fixed administrative expense of **€310,000** per annum will be incurred should this project proceed.

## Formula Sheet

- **Present Value of an Annuity**:  
  $$
  \text{Present Value of an Annuity} = \frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r}
  $$
  Where:  
  $r$ = discount rate,  
  $n$ = number of periods

- **Present Value of 1**:  
  $$
  \text{Present Value of 1} = \frac{1}{(1+r)^n}
  $$
  Where:  
  $1 = €1$,  
  $n$ = number of periods,  
  $r$ = cost of capital

- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**:  
  $$
  0 = P_0 + \frac{P_1}{(1+IRR)} + \frac{P_2}{(1+IRR)^2} + \frac{P_3}{(1+IRR)^3} + \ldots + \frac{P_n}{(1+IRR)^n}
  $$

  Where $P_0, P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$ are the cash flows in periods 0, 1, 2, ..., n respectively; and
  IRR equals the project's internal rate of return.
  
  $$
  \text{IRR} = a + \left[ \frac{\text{NPV}a}{\text{NPV}a - \text{NPV}b} \right] * (b-a)
  $$

- **Purchasing Power Parity Theory**:  
  $$
  S_1 = S_0 * \frac{(1 + hc)}{(1 + hb)}
  $$

  Where:  
  $S_1$ = future expected exchange rate of currency  
  $S_0$ = current spot exchange rate  
  $hc$ = inflation rate in counter currency  
  $hb$ = inflation rate in base country

- **Interest Rate Parity Theory**:  
  $$
  F_0 = S_0 * \frac{(1 + ic)}{(1 + ib)}
  $$
  Where:  
  $F_0 = S_1$ = forward currency exchange rate  
  $S_0$ = current spot exchange rate  
  $ic$ = interest rate in counter country  
  $ib$ = interest rate in base country
