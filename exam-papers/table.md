You're right to question this—let's clarify the Direct Cost of Sales and how it relates to the Payments for Purchases to ensure we're not double-counting any amounts.

### Explanation of Direct Cost of Sales and Payments for Purchases

1. **Direct Cost of Sales (35% of total sales)**:
   - This is the total cost incurred for the goods sold during the month. It represents the expense side of the sales, calculated as a percentage of the sales revenue.
   - This cost needs to be accounted for as an outflow, but it's not necessarily paid all at once.

2. **Payments for Purchases**:
   - These are the actual cash outflows related to buying inventory to replenish stock. 
   - The company pays 25% of the purchases in the month of purchase (cash) and 75% in the following month (credit).

The confusion might arise from how these figures are used. The Direct Cost of Sales is used to determine the necessary purchases, while the Payments for Purchases represent the actual cash outflows based on the company's payment policy.

### Corrected Approach

To avoid double-counting, let's focus on the payments made for purchases based on the company's payment terms. We will remove the Direct Cost of Sales line as a cash outflow since it's indirectly included in the Payments for Purchases.

Here’s a revised breakdown without double-counting the Direct Cost of Sales:

This should ensure that we are not double-counting any costs and correctly allocating the cash outflows based on the payment terms.
