### Question 2(b) - Management Actions for Projected Cash Surplus

Given the potential cash surplus, management can consider the following actions to capitalize on the surplus:

2. **Investment in Growth:** Invest in business expansion, such as opening new branches or upgrading facilities, which could generate higher revenue in the future.
3. **Reserve Building:** Create a cash reserve to handle future contingencies, ensuring the business has funds to manage unexpected downturns.
4. **Dividend Payments:** If the business structure allows, management could consider distributing a portion of the surplus to shareholders or owners.
5. **Reinvestment in Operations:** Enhance current operations by investing in technology, training, or marketing to boost efficiency and sales.
